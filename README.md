# Image-Captioning-CNN-RNN-Flickr8k
This repository hosts an Image Captioning Model implementation using CNN and LSTM, trained on Flickr8k dataset. It combines computer vision and NLP techniques to generate captions for images. Includes dataset prep, ResNet feature extraction, LSTM caption generation, and training. Part of my collegial Pattern recognition course.
