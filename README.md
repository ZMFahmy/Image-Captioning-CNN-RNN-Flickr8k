# Image Captioning Model Implementation

## Introduction
This repository contains an implementation of an Image Captioning Model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), on the Flickr8k dataset. Image captioning is a fascinating intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, where the goal is to generate textual descriptions for images automatically.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this implementation are:
1. Gain practical experience in implementing CNN and RNN architectures.
2. Understand the process of feature extraction from images using CNN.
3. Learn how to generate captions for images using RNN, particularly LSTM.
4. Analyze model performance using validation and test datasets.
5. Interpret model predictions and identify areas for improvement.

## Steps

### Step 1: Dataset Preparation
- Load the Flickr8k dataset from Hugging Face.
- Preprocess the dataset, including image loading, resizing, normalization, and caption preprocessing.

### Step 2: Convolution Neural Network (ResNet)
- Utilize a pre-trained ResNet model on the ImageNet dataset, freezing its layers.
- Extract image features just before the last layer of classification.
- Add a fully connected layer after ResNet to train.

### Step 3: Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)
- Utilize an LSTM network for caption generation.
- Utilize cross-entropy loss as the loss function during training.
- Apply teacher forcing during training to improve model convergence.

### Step 4: Training Procedure
- Load the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- Train the model using appropriate optimization techniques.
- Monitor loss, accuracy, and BLEU score on the validation set and report on the test set.
